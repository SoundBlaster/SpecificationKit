# Observation Completion Notes

## Step 1

codex
I can’t launch the SwiftUI app from this sandbox, but the code compiles locally
for you. Here’s a quick, reliable manual check to confirm Observation works end-
to-end:

Navigation
- App: open DemoApp with SwiftUI UI (no flags).
- Go to: Navigation → Observation.

Initial state
- Flags/counters/events:
  - Ensure “obs_flag” is off, “obs_count” is 0, and “obs_event” shows “Never”.
  - The four status rows:
    - Flag obs_flag = true: red
    - Counter obs_count < 3: green
    - Cooldown obs_event ≥ 3s: green
    - Composite: show when all true: red

Flag toggling
- Toggle “obs_flag” on:
  - “Flag obs_flag = true” turns green immediately.
  - Composite turns green only if the other two are green (underLimit and cooldo
wnOK).

Counter changes
- Tap “+1”:
  - “obs_count” increments and “Counter obs_count < 3” remains green for 0,1,2;
turns red at 3.
  - Composite follows the same logic.
- Tap “Reset”:
  - “obs_count” becomes 0; “Counter … < 3” switches back to green; Composite ree
valuates.

Event cooldown
- Tap “Record now”:
  - “obs_event” updates to current time; “Cooldown obs_event ≥ 3s” turns red imm
ediately.
  - After ~3 seconds, it auto-updates back to green (due to provider’s update +
ObservedSatisfies).
  - Composite reflects these changes in real-time.

Cross-checks
- Toggle flag off → Composite should turn red even if other two are green.
- Hit “+1” up to 3 → Counter row red; Composite red.
- Record event, wait 3s → Cooldown row returns to green automatically.

If anything does not live-update, let me know exactly which row stays stale and
what action preceded it—I’ll adjust the observation wiring. Want me to also add
an EnvironmentContextProvider observation demo (e.g., reacting to a simulated Co
lorScheme or locale change), or add observed variants for @Decides/@Maybe?

## Step 2

codex
Updated docs to reflect the new Observation feature and demo:

- README.md
  - Added “Observation for SwiftUI” to What’s New.
  - Documented `@ObservedSatisfies` usage with examples.
  - Introduced `ContextUpdatesProviding` and how providers publish updates.
  - Linked behavior to DefaultContextProvider and EnvironmentContextProvider.
  - Noted the Observation screen in DemoApp.

- DOCS/markdown/0.3.0/11_SpecificationKit_v0.3.0_TODO.md
  - Marked observation tasks as completed.
  - Added DemoApp observation screen as completed.
  - Added “Observation Completion Notes” detailing the protocol, provider update
s, wrapper, and follow-ups.

Want me to add a short GIF/screenshot reference in the README for the Observatio
n screen, or proceed to observed variants for @Decides and @Maybe?

## Summary

- Introduced `ContextUpdatesProviding` (optional) for providers to publish update signals via Combine and an `AsyncStream` bridge.
- `DefaultContextProvider` now emits updates on all state mutations (counters/flags/events/userData and registrations).
- `EnvironmentContextProvider` forwards `objectWillChange` to observation hooks.
- Added `@ObservedSatisfies` (`DynamicProperty`) for SwiftUI that re-evaluates on provider updates.
- DemoApp now includes an “Observation” screen demonstrating flags, counters, cooldowns, and a composite spec updating live.
- Follow-ups (not done): observed variants for `@Decides` and `@Maybe`; unit tests for Combine bridge could be added if we include Combine in test target.
