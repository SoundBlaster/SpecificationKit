# Summary of Work — 2025-10-30 Benchmarking Activation

## Current Status
- Dedicated benchmarking target (`SpecificationKitBenchmarks`) added; baseline utilities validated via unit coverage.
- Performance infrastructure ready for downstream optimization tasks.

## Notes for Next Agent
- Execute performance suites on macOS to avoid the Linux `CoreData` limitation until a cross-platform stub is introduced.
- Next priorities can move to P2.2 optimization tasks once benchmarking metrics are collected.

## Completed Work — 2025-10-30
- P2.1 benchmarking infrastructure delivered with baseline validator coverage.
- Commit: pending (update with hash after integration).
- Follow-up: capture baseline metrics from v2.0.0 artifacts during next benchmarking session.
