# Summary of Work â€” Parameterized @Satisfies Kickoff (2025-11-19)

## Current Focus
- Design parameterized entry points for the `@Satisfies` wrapper so specs that require labeled arguments can be constructed without manual instances or macro-only pathways.
- Stage supporting test coverage and documentation updates that validate the new wrapper ergonomics across macro and non-macro usage.

## Recent Archive
- Archived the "Baseline Capture Reset" workstream to `AGENTS_DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/6_Baseline_Capture_Reset/`, including historical summaries, blocker notes, and benchmark follow-ups.

## Immediate Actions
- Prototype a wrapper initializer that accepts a specification type alongside labeled arguments and forwards them safely to the spec's initializer.
- Expand unit and macro tests to exercise the parameterized wrapper syntax and refresh documentation snippets to highlight the improved ergonomics.

## Tracking Notes
- `AGENTS_DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` captures the actionable breakdown for the wrapper work.
- `AGENTS_DOCS/INPROGRESS/blocked.md` retains the recoverable macOS benchmark dependency while the hardware prerequisite remains unresolved.
- Roadmap documents (`AGENTS_DOCS/markdown/00_SpecificationKit_TODO.md`, `AGENTS_DOCS/markdown/3.0.0/tasks/SpecificationKit_v3.0.0_Progress.md`) were updated to point to the new archive folder and reflect the shift to wrapper parameterization.
- No permanent blockers were added during archival; `AGENTS_DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/BLOCKED/` remains absent as of this snapshot.

## Next Status Update
- Document prototype findings for the new initializer and outline any compiler diagnostics or type-inference risks before implementation begins.
