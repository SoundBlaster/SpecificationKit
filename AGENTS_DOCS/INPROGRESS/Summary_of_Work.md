# Summary of Work â€” Ready for Baseline Capture

## Status Overview
- Prior benchmarking activation artifacts archived under `AGENTS_DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/4_Benchmarking_Infrastructure/`.
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now provisions hosted macOS hardware for `swift build`, `swift test`, and benchmark product execution.
- Awaiting baseline metric capture and AnySpecification optimization planning powered by the new benchmark suite.
- 2025-11-18 session confirmed the local automation container still lacks macOS support; `swift build` / `swift test` abort with `no such module 'CoreData'`, so use the macOS CI workflow until dedicated hardware is secured for baseline capture.

## Notes for Next Agent
- Start with the actionable items in `next_tasks.md`; create a new dated log once baseline runs begin.
- Log any platform-specific blockers (e.g., Linux CoreData gaps) in `blocked.md` so they can be escalated to the permanent archive if they become long-term issues.
- Coordinate with infra stakeholders to secure macOS execution path before attempting the benchmark run again; reference the blocker entry logged on 2025-11-18 for context.

## Recent Updates
- 2025-11-19 configured macOS CI workflow to unlock hosted hardware for build/test + benchmark execution; baseline capture remains to be scheduled.
- 2025-10-30 benchmarking deliverables archived with summary and follow-up notes.
