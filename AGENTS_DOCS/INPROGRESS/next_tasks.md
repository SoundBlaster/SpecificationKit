# Next Tasks

## 1. Stand up P2.1 Benchmarking Infrastructure
- **Why:** Critical path for Phase 2 performance work per `AGENTS_DOCS/markdown/3.0.0/tasks/03_performance_tasks.md` and implementation plan.
- **Immediate steps:**
  - Scaffold `Tests/SpecificationKitBenchmarks` target and add to `Package.swift`.
  - Capture baseline numbers from v2.0.0 artifacts noted in the performance backlog.
  - Implement initial XCTest `measure` suites for specification evaluation and property wrapper overhead.
- **Success signal:** Benchmarks run locally with documented baselines so P2.2 optimization tasks can begin.

_No additional active workstreams are tracked at this time._
