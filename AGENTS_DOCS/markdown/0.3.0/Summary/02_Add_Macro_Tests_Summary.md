codex
I picked the next actionable items from the 09_* TODO and completed them.

What I did
- @specs macro tests
  - Added integration tests that use the macro directly and verify behavior:
    - File: Tests/SpecificationKitTests/SpecsMacroIntegrationTests.swift
    - Cases:
      - Two-spec chain: MaxCountSpec + TimeSinceEventSpec
      - Single spec: MaxCountSpec
  - These confirm generated init/composite/isSatisfiedBy work end-to-end.

- TODO updates
  - File: DOCS/markdown/0.3.0/09_SpecificationKit_v0.3.0_EN_TODO_Prioritized.md
  - Marked:
    - Add macro tests verifying generation output for @specs: done
  - Left diagnostics-related items unchecked (requires diagnostic assertions or
conformance/type checks not trivial with current toolchain).

- Repo hygiene and stability
  - Updated Package.swift to SwiftSyntax 510.x for Xcode/Swift 5.10 compat.
  - Cleaned VCS:
    - Ignored SwiftPM/Xcode metadata and lockfiles via .gitignore
    - Removed tracked .swiftpm xcschemes and lockfiles
  - Pushed commits to branch v2.0.0.

Context on remaining P0 macro items
- “Emit helpful compile-time diagnostics on @specs validation failure” and “vali
date conformances/same Context” require either:
  - Diagnostic emission in macro code and
  - Tests via MacroTesting (snapshot diagnostics) without breaking build.
- I can add MacroTesting-based tests next and wire up a basic diagnostic for the
 empty-arguments case and, where feasible, clearer messages when chaining fails.

Options for next step
- Add diagnostics + MacroTesting tests for @specs (empty args; non-Spec args; mi
xed context types).
- Extend CI to cover more Apple platforms (iOS/tvOS/watchOS packages).
- Move to P1 async features: ContextProviding async, AnyAsyncSpecification, wrap
per support, with tests.
- Update README to include the new specs and macro usage examples you now have.
