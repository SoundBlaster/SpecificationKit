# SpecificationKit v3.0.0 Technical Specification & PRD

## 1. Scope and Intent

SpecificationKit v3.0.0 will deliver a major upgrade to the SpecificationKit library for Swift.  The primary objective of this release is to address outstanding items from the v0.3.0 roadmap, enhance the existing macro system, improve package distribution, polish performance, introduce a new set of property wrappers and specification types, expand context provider capabilities, deliver tooling for testing and debugging, and provide platform‑specific integrations.  Additionally, the release will modernize the API for Swift 6 compatibility and lay groundwork for future extensibility.  Success is defined by the completion of all tasks in this specification, the absence of regressions in existing features, documented migration instructions for breaking changes, and the publication of a semantically versioned release tag (3.0.0) with accompanying documentation and examples.

### Deliverables

- Updated source code implementing all mandatory tasks listed herein.
- A comprehensive set of unit tests covering new features and negative scenarios.
- Benchmarks demonstrating performance characteristics of specification composition and macro generation.
- Updated package metadata (Package.swift) and license conformance suitable for Swift Package Index submission.
- Documentation updates, including API reference, tutorials, examples, and a migration guide from v2.x to v3.0.0.
- New developer tooling (tracer, profiler, visualization) as described.
- Platform‑specific context providers and integrations.

### Success Criteria

- All tasks flagged as High priority are completed and verified through tests and benchmarks.
- All new APIs follow Swift API Design Guidelines and naming conventions.
- The release compiles without warnings on supported platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS) with Swift 6.
- Benchmarks show no regression (>5 %) in specification evaluation time compared to v2.0.0, with macro compilation times within acceptable limits (<10 % overhead).
- Documentation and examples are complete, accurate, and published with the release.

### Assumptions & Constraints

- Toolchain dependencies: Several tasks depend on macro conformances that are unavailable in current Swift toolchains.  These tasks are marked as blocked and will be addressed when compiler support becomes available.
- Semantic versioning: Breaking changes must be intentionally planned and accompanied by a migration guide.  Backward compatibility should be maintained when feasible within semantic versioning rules.
- External dependencies: Remote providers (e.g., NetworkContextProvider) may depend on third‑party libraries (e.g., URLSession).  These dependencies must not violate open‑source license compatibility.
- Concurrency & thread safety: All new providers and specifications must be thread‑safe or clearly document concurrency restrictions.

## 2. Hierarchical TODO Plan

The plan is organized into phases (P0–P3) and breaking changes considerations.  Each task is atomic, verifiable, and grouped for clarity.  Dependencies and blocking conditions are explicitly stated.

### 2.1. P0 — Critical Path (Carried Forward from v0.3.0)

#### 2.1.1. Toolchain‑Dependent Features (Blocked)

1.	Ensure provider Context matches spec Context for @AutoContext
- Input: Macro @AutoContext, specification types.
- Process: Implement compile‑time validation ensuring that the generated provider conforms to the Context type expected by the specification.
- Output: Macro emits error when context types mismatch; tests verifying matching contexts compile and mismatched contexts fail.
- Blocked: Requires conformance‑checking macro support in the toolchain.
2. Provide tests showing @AutoContext works with @Satisfies without manual context
- Input: Example specs using @Satisfies and @AutoContext.
- Process: Create unit tests demonstrating that the provider injection path works correctly without explicitly passing context.
- Output: Tests compile and pass when toolchain support is available.
- Blocked: Depends on the resolution of task 1; provider‑based path currently covered by tests.
3. Add negative tests for @AutoContext type mismatches
- Input: Invalid combinations of specifications and providers.
- Process: Create unit tests that intentionally mismatch the Context type to confirm that the macro reports compile‑time errors.
- Output: Failing tests demonstrate correct error diagnostics.
- Blocked: Same toolchain dependency as above.

### 2.2. P1 — Important Enhancements

#### 2.2.1. Macro System Enhancements

1. Hooks for future flags in `@AutoContext`

2. Support constructing specs via wrapper parameters
- Input: Property wrapper `@Satisfies` implementation and specification types accepting parameters (e.g., `CooldownIntervalSpec` requiring an interval).
- Process: Extend wrapper attribute syntax to accept using and additional parameters; update macro to instantiate the specified spec type with provided arguments; adjust generic constraints to infer parameter types.  Provide unit tests using `@Satisfies(using: CooldownIntervalSpec.self, interval: 10)` and similar patterns.

## 4. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 4.1. Feature Descriptions & Rationale

SpecificationKit v3.0.0 introduces a cohesive set of enhancements driven by developer feedback and the need to scale the library across more complex scenarios:

1.	Enhanced Property Wrapper Ecosystem:  Expands the declarative syntax for decision and optional results (@Decides, @Maybe) to support reactive observation, caching, and conditional logic.  Rationale: developers need more expressive wrappers that integrate seamlessly with SwiftUI and support performance optimisations such as caching.
2.	Advanced Specification Types:  Introduces powerful specification constructs (weighted, historical, comparative, threshold) enabling probabilistic, historical, and comparative evaluations.  Rationale: real‑world business logic often requires scoring, trend analysis, or relative comparisons that go beyond boolean checks.
3.	Context Provider Enhancements:  Adds remote, persistent, composite providers and validation.  Rationale: applications increasingly rely on remote configuration and persistent state; providing first‑class support reduces boilerplate and improves reliability.
4.	Testing & Debugging Tooling:  Offers tracers, profilers, builders, and visualization tools.  Rationale: as specifications grow in complexity, debugging and performance analysis become critical; built‑in tooling accelerates development and reduces errors.
5.	Platform‑Specific Features:  Provides context values tailored to iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.  Rationale: platform integration increases adoption by providing ready‑to‑use context data without requiring developers to write platform glue code.
6.	Integration & Interoperability:  Supports SwiftData, Combine, Core Data, and CloudKit.  Rationale: persistence and reactive patterns are common in modern apps; official integrations simplify adoption.
7.	Documentation & Examples:  Comprehensive tutorials, playgrounds, sample apps, and migration guides ensure that developers can learn and adopt the library efficiently.
8.	API Modernization & Architecture Improvements:  Aligns the API with Swift 6 guidelines, removes deprecated APIs, simplifies generics, and modularizes the package.  Rationale: maintainability and forward‑compatibility are essential for long‑term sustainability.

### 4.2. Functional Requirements

For each feature group, the following functional requirements must be met:

1.	Reactive Property Wrappers:
- @observedDecides and @observedMaybe must conform to DynamicProperty and emit updates via SwiftUI when their underlying specification result changes.
- @CachedSatisfies must cache evaluation results for a configurable TTL and provide invalidation mechanisms.
- @ConditionalSatisfies must choose between specifications based on a runtime predicate without sacrificing type safety.
2.	Advanced Specification Types:
- WeightedSpec must accept a collection of spec–weight pairs and return results according to the defined probability distribution.
- HistoricalSpec must access time‑series data from context providers and apply user‑defined conditions (e.g., thresholds over a window).
- ComparativeSpec must compare two or more candidate values and return an indicator of the winner or ranking result.
- ThresholdSpec must evaluate numeric conditions with configurable inclusive/exclusive bounds.
3.	Context Providers:
- NetworkContextProvider must fetch and cache configuration data, handle network errors, and allow offline fallback.
- PersistentContextProvider must persist context values to Core Data or SQLite and support migration.
- CompositeContextProvider must merge values from multiple providers using a deterministic strategy.
- Validation functionality must check context values against defined schemas and produce meaningful errors.
4.	Testing & Debugging:
- SpecificationTracer must record the evaluation sequence of specifications, including sub‑specifications.
- SpecificationProfiler must measure evaluation times at each node and provide aggregated reports.
- Visualization tools must generate diagrams of specification trees without requiring manual intervention.
5.	Platform‑Specific Providers:
- iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS providers must expose platform‑specific context values while respecting privacy and system restrictions.
- Providers must gracefully handle unavailable features (e.g., HealthKit permissions not granted).
6.	Integration:
- SwiftData integration must allow saving and restoring specification state with minimal configuration.
- Combine publishers must emit changes in specification results and integrate with @observed* wrappers.
- Core Data templates must allow developers to persist specification metadata.
- CloudKit support must synchronize specification states across devices with conflict resolution.
7.	Documentation & Examples:
- Tutorials and sample apps must compile without modification and clearly demonstrate how to implement typical use cases.
- Migration guide must list each breaking change and provide a recommended migration path.
8.	API & Architecture:
- API names must follow Swift 6 naming guidelines; deprecated names must emit compile warnings.
- Modules must be logically separated to allow importing only necessary functionality.
- Dependency injection patterns must be consistent across the library.

### 4.3. Non‑Functional Requirements

- Performance:  Macro expansion and compilation must not increase build times by more than 10 % compared with v2.0.0.  Specification evaluation should remain as efficient as in v2.x or better.  Async implementations must avoid blocking threads.
- Scalability:  The architecture must allow addition of new specification types, wrappers, and providers without modifications to core modules.  Providers must support caching and batching to reduce network or disk overhead.
- Thread Safety:  All public APIs must be safe to call from concurrent contexts or explicitly document constraints.  Context providers must synchronize access to shared state.
- Security & Compliance:  Remote providers must use secure network protocols (HTTPS), validate server certificates, and follow platform privacy guidelines.  Persistent providers must respect user privacy preferences and store sensitive data securely.
- Portability:  The library must compile and run on supported Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS) with Swift 6.  Platform‑specific providers must be guarded with #if directives to prevent compilation on unsupported platforms.
- Documentation Quality:  Documentation must be generated with DocC and accessible offline via Xcode.  Examples must compile successfully.  All public symbols must be documented.

### 4.4. User Interaction Flows

Although SpecificationKit is primarily a developer library, typical developer interaction flows must be considered:
1.	Defining a Specification:  A developer creates a new specification type (e.g., UserScoreSpec) conforming to Specification and optionally registers it with @specs or uses it directly in code.
2.	Using Property Wrappers:  The developer annotates properties in a ViewModel or SwiftUI view with @Satisfies, @Decides, @Maybe, or new wrappers like @CachedSatisfies to declare business rules.  When context changes, reactive wrappers automatically update.
3.	Providing Context:  The developer registers a context provider (e.g., DefaultContextProvider.shared or a custom provider such as NetworkContextProvider) either globally or via @AutoContext.  Composite providers can be configured to merge multiple sources.
4.	Debugging & Profiling:  When behaviour is unexpected, the developer wraps evaluations in SpecificationTracer or runs SpecificationProfiler to see execution paths and timing.  Visualization tools help draw graphs for documentation.
5.	Persisting State:  If persistence is required, the developer uses PersistentContextProvider and/or SwiftData/Core Data models to save specification state.  Combine publishers notify when persisted state changes.
6.	Deploying Across Platforms:  The developer includes platform‑specific context providers in iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS targets as needed.  CloudKit synchronization ensures consistent specification states across devices.

### 4.5. Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios

- Context Mismatches:  When a specification expects a context type not provided by the current provider, macros should emit compile‑time errors.  Runtime evaluations must fail fast with clear diagnostics.
- Network Failures:  NetworkContextProvider must handle unreachable servers, invalid JSON, or timeouts by falling back to cached or default values, and optionally report errors via logs or Combine publishers.
- Persistent Storage Errors:  PersistentContextProvider must gracefully handle database corruption, migration failures, or file I/O errors; the API should surface errors to developers with recovery suggestions.
- Concurrency Issues:  Simultaneous updates to a context must not corrupt state.  Providers must implement appropriate locking or isolation strategies.
- Invalid Specifications:  Misconfigured WeightedSpec (e.g., weights not summing to a positive value) or ComparativeSpec (e.g., empty candidate list) must throw clear initialization errors.
- Platform Limitations:  Platform‑specific providers must detect when data is unavailable (e.g., HealthKit not authorised) and either supply default values or throw descriptive errors.
- Migration Pitfalls:  When deprecated APIs are removed, clients failing to migrate should encounter compile errors with clear messages.  Migration guide must highlight these changes.

## 5. Conclusion

The v3.0.0 roadmap for SpecificationKit sets an ambitious goal: to transform the library into a comprehensive, performance‑optimised, and highly extensible framework that addresses real‑world business rules across multiple platforms.  This technical specification decomposes the high‑level goals into detailed, atomic tasks with defined priorities, effort estimates, required tools, acceptance criteria, and dependencies.  The PRD section clarifies the rationale, functional and non‑functional requirements, developer flows, and edge cases.  By following this plan, an LLM‑powered agent or development team can execute the work systematically and deliver a stable, feature‑rich release without ambiguity or guesswork.
