# SpecificationKit v3.0.0 Technical Specification & PRD

## 1. Scope and Intent

SpecificationKit v3.0.0 will deliver a major upgrade to the SpecificationKit library for Swift.  The primary objective of this release is to address outstanding items from the v0.3.0 roadmap, enhance the existing macro system, improve package distribution, polish performance, introduce a new set of property wrappers and specification types, expand context provider capabilities, deliver tooling for testing and debugging, and provide platform‑specific integrations.  Additionally, the release will modernize the API for Swift 6 compatibility and lay groundwork for future extensibility.  Success is defined by the completion of all tasks in this specification, the absence of regressions in existing features, documented migration instructions for breaking changes, and the publication of a semantically versioned release tag (3.0.0) with accompanying documentation and examples.

### Deliverables

- Updated source code implementing all mandatory tasks listed herein.
- A comprehensive set of unit tests covering new features and negative scenarios.
- Benchmarks demonstrating performance characteristics of specification composition and macro generation.
- Updated package metadata (Package.swift) and license conformance suitable for Swift Package Index submission.
- Documentation updates, including API reference, tutorials, examples, and a migration guide from v2.x to v3.0.0.
- New developer tooling (tracer, profiler, visualization) as described.
- Platform‑specific context providers and integrations.

### Success Criteria

- All tasks flagged as High priority are completed and verified through tests and benchmarks.
- All new APIs follow Swift API Design Guidelines and naming conventions.
- The release compiles without warnings on supported platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS) with Swift 6.
- Benchmarks show no regression (>5 %) in specification evaluation time compared to v2.0.0, with macro compilation times within acceptable limits (<10 % overhead).
- Documentation and examples are complete, accurate, and published with the release.

### Assumptions & Constraints

- Toolchain dependencies: Several tasks depend on macro conformances that are unavailable in current Swift toolchains.  These tasks are marked as blocked and will be addressed when compiler support becomes available.
- Semantic versioning: Breaking changes must be intentionally planned and accompanied by a migration guide.  Backward compatibility should be maintained when feasible within semantic versioning rules.
- External dependencies: Remote providers (e.g., NetworkContextProvider) may depend on third‑party libraries (e.g., URLSession).  These dependencies must not violate open‑source license compatibility.
- Concurrency & thread safety: All new providers and specifications must be thread‑safe or clearly document concurrency restrictions.

## 2. Hierarchical TODO Plan

The plan is organized into phases (P0–P3) and breaking changes considerations.  Each task is atomic, verifiable, and grouped for clarity.  Dependencies and blocking conditions are explicitly stated.

### 2.1. P0 — Critical Path (Carried Forward from v0.3.0)

#### 2.1.1. Toolchain‑Dependent Features (Blocked)

1.	Ensure provider Context matches spec Context for @AutoContext
- Input: Macro @AutoContext, specification types.
- Process: Implement compile‑time validation ensuring that the generated provider conforms to the Context type expected by the specification.
- Output: Macro emits error when context types mismatch; tests verifying matching contexts compile and mismatched contexts fail.
- Blocked: Requires conformance‑checking macro support in the toolchain.
2. Provide tests showing @AutoContext works with @Satisfies without manual context
- Input: Example specs using @Satisfies and @AutoContext.
- Process: Create unit tests demonstrating that the provider injection path works correctly without explicitly passing context.
- Output: Tests compile and pass when toolchain support is available.
- Blocked: Depends on the resolution of task 1; provider‑based path currently covered by tests.
3. Add negative tests for @AutoContext type mismatches
- Input: Invalid combinations of specifications and providers.
- Process: Create unit tests that intentionally mismatch the Context type to confirm that the macro reports compile‑time errors.
- Output: Failing tests demonstrate correct error diagnostics.
- Blocked: Same toolchain dependency as above.
