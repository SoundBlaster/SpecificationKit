# Archive Summary â€” P2.1 Benchmarking Infrastructure

## Highlights
- Dedicated `SpecificationKitBenchmarks` target created with reusable baseline validation utilities to measure spec performance.
- Legacy performance cases migrated and expanded to exercise macro compilation and wrapper overhead scenarios per v3 roadmap.
- Documentation trackers updated to mark P2.1 as delivered and to surface Linux `CoreData` limitations for future runs.

## Key Artifacts
- `2025-10-30_NextTask_Benchmarking_Infrastructure.md`
- `Summary_of_Work.md`
- `next_tasks.md` (historic)
- `blocked.md` (no recoverable blockers)

## Follow-ups Captured for Next Cycle
- Collect v2.0.0 baseline metrics using the new benchmark suite and attach results to the benchmarking log.
- Prioritize P2.2 AnySpecification optimization once baseline metrics are recorded.
- Track Linux CoreData availability gap; run full suite on macOS until a cross-platform stub is implemented.
