# Property Wrapper Edge-Case Coverage â€” Archive Summary

## Highlights
- Wrapped up the 2025-10-29 property wrapper validation effort, focusing on async cache projections and failure handling for `@CachedSatisfies`.
- Documented completion details in [`Summary_of_Work.md`](./Summary_of_Work.md) and the task selection rationale in [`2025-10-29_NextTask_PropertyWrapperEdgeCases.md`](./2025-10-29_NextTask_PropertyWrapperEdgeCases.md).
- Captured post-task follow-ups, including the P2.1 benchmarking infrastructure bootstrap, in the preserved [`next_tasks.md`](./next_tasks.md).

## Links & References
- Backlog alignment: see updated entries in [`../../markdown/00_SpecificationKit_TODO.md`](../../markdown/00_SpecificationKit_TODO.md).
- Phase tracker context: refreshed notes inside [`../../markdown/3.0.0/tasks/SpecificationKit_v3.0.0_Progress.md`](../../markdown/3.0.0/tasks/SpecificationKit_v3.0.0_Progress.md).

## Next Steps
- Resume work by pulling actionable items from the rebuilt `AGENTS_DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` scaffold.
- Benchmarks remain the leading priority for the upcoming cycle; no recoverable blockers were recorded at archive time.
