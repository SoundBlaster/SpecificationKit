## Additional Issues

- [x] **Performance Timing Issue** *(resolved 2025-11-19)*: Updated `PerformanceBenchmarks` to use a dedicated `BenchmarkTimer` helper so the reported execution time reflects only the looped work rather than XCTest's measurement overhead.

- [x] **Outdated Availability Check** *(resolved 2025-11-19)*: Simplified the fallback path in `BenchmarkValidation` to rely on `FileManager.temporaryDirectory`, aligning the implementation with the package's supported OS versions.
