# Baseline Capture Reset â€” Archive Summary (2025-11-19)

## Archived Focus
- Capturing macOS release baselines for `SpecificationKitBenchmarks` and preparing the P2.2 AnySpecification optimization plan.
- Investigating Linux-safe options for running CoreData-dependent benchmark coverage inside CI.

## Key Artifacts
- `Summary_of_Work.md` preserves the day-to-day status log at the time of archival.
- `next_tasks.md` documents the outstanding follow-ups that were triaged during the archive hand-off.
- `blocked.md` records the macOS hardware dependency that prevented immediate baseline capture.
- `2025-11-01_NextTask_WrapperParameterSupport.md` retains the selection rationale for the upcoming `@Satisfies` wrapper work.
- `ISSUES.md` and `issue-macos-iokit-import.md` capture completed fixes from the workstream.

## Notable Outcomes
- Benchmarks were refactored to use a reusable `BenchmarkTimer`, and macOS-specific imports were restored so the validation harness compiles on Apple platforms.
- Documentation and roadmap trackers were aligned with the macOS baseline objective ahead of this archival checkpoint.

## Follow-up Notes
- Active next steps and recoverable blockers have been re-established under `AGENTS_DOCS/INPROGRESS/` to resume planning for parameterized `@Satisfies` initializers.
- The macOS hardware prerequisite remains tracked as a recoverable blocker; no permanent blockers were identified during archival.
