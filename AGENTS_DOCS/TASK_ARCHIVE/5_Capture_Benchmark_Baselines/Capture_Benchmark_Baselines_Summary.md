# Capture Benchmark Baselines — Archive Summary

## Session Highlights
- Documented the macOS-only requirement for running `SpecificationKitBenchmarks` and captured rationale for prioritizing baseline metrics.
- Ensured the GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` provisions hosted macOS hardware for release builds, tests, and benchmark execution.
- Preserved the dated task log (`2025-10-31_NextTask_Benchmark_Baselines.md`) and status recap (`Summary_of_Work.md`) for historical context.

## Key Artifacts
- `2025-10-31_NextTask_Benchmark_Baselines.md` — selection notes, implementation checklist, and progress history.
- `Summary_of_Work.md` — ready-state overview describing infrastructure readiness and outstanding work.
- `next_tasks.md` — actionable follow-ups migrated into the refreshed in-progress tracker.
- `blocked.md` — recoverable hardware blocker awaiting macOS execution path.

## Remaining Work & Follow-Ups
- Fresh `AGENTS_DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` re-centered on capturing macOS baselines, drafting P2.2 optimizations, and Linux compatibility exploration.
- `AGENTS_DOCS/INPROGRESS/blocked.md` retains the macOS hardware requirement with updated guidance for triggering the hosted workflow.
- Backlog trackers (`AGENTS_DOCS/markdown/00_SpecificationKit_TODO.md` §11 and `AGENTS_DOCS/markdown/3.0.0/tasks/SpecificationKit_v3.0.0_Progress.md`) now reference this archive folder for context.

## Blockers & Dependencies
- Baseline capture still depends on macOS hardware; the recoverable blocker is mirrored in the active `blocked.md` until execution is scheduled.
- Linux CoreData limitation remains unresolved; see `AGENTS_DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/4_Benchmarking_Infrastructure/` for earlier analysis when planning compatibility work.
