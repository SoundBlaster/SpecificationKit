Explore sophisticated specification patterns including weighted decisions, historical analysis, and adaptive thresholds.

## Overview

SpecificationKit v3.0.0 introduces advanced specification types that enable sophisticated decision-making patterns. These specifications are designed for real-world scenarios requiring probabilistic selection, time-series analysis, comparative evaluation, and dynamic thresholds.

This tutorial covers:
- ``WeightedSpec`` for probabilistic decision making
- ``HistoricalSpec`` for time-series analysis
- ``ComparativeSpec`` for relative comparisons
- ``ThresholdSpec`` for adaptive thresholds

## Section 1: Probabilistic Decisions with WeightedSpec

@ContentAndMedia {
    Learn how to implement A/B testing, feature rollouts, and load balancing using probabilistic specifications.

    ``WeightedSpec`` enables weighted random selection among multiple candidates, perfect for experiments and gradual feature rollouts.
}

@Steps {
    @Step {
        Set up a basic A/B test scenario.

        Create specifications for different feature variants and define their weights.

        @Code(name: "ABTestExample.swift", file: "advanced-01-weighted-basic.swift")
    }

    @Step {
        Implement weighted selection with results.

        Use ``WeightedSpec`` to randomly select between variants based on their weights.

    }
}

## Section 2: Time-Series Analysis with HistoricalSpec

@ContentAndMedia {

}

@Steps {
    @Step {
        Create a custom historical data provider.

        Implement ``HistoricalDataProviding`` to supply time-series data for analysis.

        @Code(name: "PerformanceMonitor.swift", file: "advanced-05-historical-provider.swift")
    }

    @Step {
        Set up historical analysis specifications.

        Configure ``HistoricalSpec`` for different types of time-series analysis.

            @Image(source: "historical-analysis-types", alt: "Historical Analysis Types")
        }
    }

    @Step {
        Implement trend detection.

        Use historical specifications to detect performance trends and anomalies.

        @Code(name: "PerformanceMonitor.swift", file: "advanced-07-trend-detection.swift")
    }

    @Step {
        Build adaptive monitoring dashboards.

        Create SwiftUI views that react to historical analysis results.

        @Code(name: "MonitoringDashboard.swift", file: "advanced-08-historical-ui.swift")
    }
}

## Section 3: Relative Comparisons with ComparativeSpec

@ContentAndMedia {
    Implement validation and monitoring using relative comparisons against baselines, ranges, and custom rules.

    ``ComparativeSpec`` excels at validation scenarios where you need to compare current values against expected ranges or baselines.
}

@Steps {
    @Step {
        Define comparison specifications.

        Create specifications that compare values against fixed thresholds and ranges.

        @Code(name: "ValidationSystem.swift", file: "advanced-09-comparative-basic.swift")
    }

    @Step {
        Implement range-based validation.

        Use range comparisons for validating values within acceptable bounds.

        @Code(name: "ValidationSystem.swift", file: "advanced-10-comparative-ranges.swift") {
            @Image(source: "range-validation-diagram", alt: "Range Validation Process")
        }
    }

    @Step {
        Add tolerance-based comparisons.

        Handle floating-point comparisons with configurable tolerance levels.

        @Code(name: "ValidationSystem.swift", file: "advanced-11-comparative-tolerance.swift")
    }

    @Step {
        Build real-time validation UI.

        Create responsive validation interfaces using comparative specifications.

        @Code(name: "ValidationView.swift", file: "advanced-12-comparative-ui.swift")
    }
}

## Section 4: Dynamic Thresholds with ThresholdSpec

@ContentAndMedia {
    Implement adaptive thresholds that change based on context, functions, or external conditions.

    ``ThresholdSpec`` provides flexible threshold evaluation for alerting, feature gating, and adaptive system behavior.
}

## Best Practices

### Performance Considerations

- Use ``CachedSatisfies`` for expensive historical analysis
- Implement efficient data providers for time-series data
- Consider memory usage when storing large historical datasets
- Use appropriate window sizes for historical analysis

### Testing Strategies

- Mock data providers for consistent test results
- Test edge cases like empty historical data
- Verify weighted selection distributions over large samples
- Test threshold adaptations under various conditions

### Architecture Guidelines

- Keep specification logic separate from data retrieval
- Use dependency injection for data providers
- Implement proper error handling for data provider failures
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data
