## Additional Issues

- **Performance Timing Issue**: In `Tests/SpecificationKitBenchmarks/PerformanceBenchmarks.swift:89`, the execution time calculation includes the overhead of the measure block itself, not just the timed operations. `startTime` should be captured inside the measure closure, or the timing logic should be moved outside the measure block to avoid measuring XCTest's measurement infrastructure overhead.

- **Outdated Availability Check**: In `Tests/SpecificationKitBenchmarks/BenchmarkValidation.swift:247`, the availability check for macOS 10.12, iOS 10.0, tvOS 10.0, watchOS 3.0 is outdated given that the `Package.swift` likely specifies higher minimum platform versions. These OS versions were released in 2016 and are no longer supported. Consider removing this availability check or updating it to match the package's minimum supported platforms.
