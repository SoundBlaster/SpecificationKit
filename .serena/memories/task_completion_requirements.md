# Task Completion Requirements

## Quality Gates (Must Pass)
- `swift test` - All tests must pass (100%)
- `swift build` - Must compile without warnings
- Performance benchmarks must meet requirements (<1ms for simple specs)
- Thread safety validation under concurrent access
- Documentation completeness check (100% for public APIs)

## Performance Requirements
- Specification evaluation: <1ms for simple specs
- Macro compilation overhead: <10% vs manual implementation
- Memory usage increase: <10% vs v2.0.0 baseline
- Thread safety: ALL public APIs must be concurrency-safe

## Documentation Requirements
- Update README.md with new features and examples
- Generate DocC documentation for all public APIs
- Include usage examples and best practices
- Migration guides for API changes

## Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage: >90% for all new features
- Integration testing across all platforms
- Performance validation for each major feature
- Regression testing (existing tests must pass)

## Progress Tracking
- Update `SpecificationKit_v3.0.0_Progress.md` immediately upon completion
- Mark phase completion when all phase tasks are done
- Calculate and update overall progress percentage
- Report blockers immediately in progress tracker

## Code Review
- Mandatory for all implementations
- Coordinate with other specialists for shared resources
- Verify Swift 6 compliance
- Ensure no breaking changes without proper migration path
